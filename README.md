- [webpack 2](https://webpack.js.org/)
- [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io)
- [Selenium](http://www.seleniumhq.org/)
- [Selenium Standalone](https://github.com/vvo/selenium-standalone)
- [WebdriverIO](http://webdriver.io/)
- [WebdriverIO Jasmine](https://github.com/webdriverio/wdio-jasmine-framework)
- [WebdriverIO Selenium Standalone Service](https://github.com/webdriverio/wdio-selenium-standalone-service)
- [WebdriverIO Spec Reporter](https://github.com/webdriverio/wdio-spec-reporter)
- [WebdriverIO webpack Service](http://webdriver.io/guide/services/webpack.html)
- [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com)
- [WebdriverIO BrowserStack](https://github.com/itszero/wdio-browserstack-service)

This is also based of my boilerplate which can be found [here](https://github.com/daisymarie128/boilerplate)<br>
